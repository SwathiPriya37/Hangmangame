Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to identify a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. The objective is to guess the word correctly before running out of chances.

How It Works
Game Setup:

A random word is chosen, but it is hidden from the player.
The word is represented by underscores (_) for each letter, showing its length.
Player's Turn:

The player guesses a single letter at a time.
If the guessed letter is in the word:
It is revealed in its correct position(s).
If the guessed letter is not in the word:
The player loses one chance (a part of the "hangman" figure is drawn).
Chances:

The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (typically 6).
Each wrong guess adds a part to the drawing of a stick-figure "hangman."
The hangman is fully drawn after the final wrong guess, ending the game.
Win or Lose:

The player wins by guessing all the letters in the word.
The player loses if they run out of guesses before completing the word.
Hangman Drawing
Traditionally, with each incorrect guess, a part of the stick figure is drawn:

Head
Body
Left arm
Right arm
Left leg
Right leg
If the figure is complete, the game ends.
